# BirdWatching Refactor Game (C# Version)

The goal of the game is to refactor the code in the master branch following the SOLID PRINCIPLES.
You can find a possible solution in the project branches.


I presented the [Java Version](https://github.com/sleli/BirdWatching_Java/) of this game at several conferences, here some materials:
